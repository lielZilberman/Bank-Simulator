# my bank simulator

a bank application, just enter your username which is your first letter of your first name combined with the first letter of your last name.

for example if your name is "Michael Jordan" your username would be "mj"

after you log in to your account you can see your balance, change your PIN, transfer money to another account, ask for a loan, close your account, see all the movements that you have ever done with this bank account and sort it.
